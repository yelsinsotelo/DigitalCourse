One of the most challenging issues in circuit design is timing.
______________________________________
|Propagation and Contamination delay |
--------------------------------------
those are characteristics of combinational circuit
tpd => propagation delay 
Is the maximum time from when the outpur changes until the output or outputs reach their final values
tcd => contamination delay
Is the minimum time from when an input changes until any output starts to change its value

Tpd an Tcd may be for many reasons as : 
1. different rising and falling delay
2. multiples inputs and outputs, some of which are faster than other
3. circuits slowing down when hot and speeding up when cold
