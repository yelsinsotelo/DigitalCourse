One of the most challenging issues in circuit design is timing.
______________________________________
|Propagation and Contamination delay |
--------------------------------------
those are characteristics of combinational circuit
tpd => propagation delay 
Is the maximum time from when the outpur changes until the output or outputs reach their final values
tcd => contamination delay
Is the minimum time from when an input changes until any output starts to change its value

Tpd an Tcd may be for many reasons as : 
1. different rising and falling delay
2. multiples inputs and outputs, some of which are faster than other
3. circuits slowing down when hot and speeding up when cold 

the propagation and contamination delays are also determined by path a signal take from 
input to output.

critica path: it limits the speed at which the circuits operates.

____________
| Glitches |  (Generally, it isn't problem)
------------

so far we have discussed the case where a single input transition 
causes a single output transition. However, it is posible that a single input transition
can causes multiple output transitions. These are called glitches or hazards.

It is important to realize that they exist and recognize them when looking at timming diagram.
